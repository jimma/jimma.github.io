If you have tried install JRE9 runtime, you'll find the Java 9 support stuff can be only found for the next eclipse release(Oxygen). To get the java 9 support in Neon, follow the following steps:
- Download and instlal Neon packages direclty from [Neon3.RC3](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/Neon/3.RC3) and don't use an installer 
- launch eclipse and Go to  Help->Install New Softeware and pointed this site http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.6-P-builds to install all stuff like ![Java9 for neon](/img/neon-java9.jpg)
I don't understand why the java9 support thing can be found in marketplace for eclipse oxygen and not for already released neon.
